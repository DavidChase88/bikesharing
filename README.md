## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is for Kate and I to determine if the bike sharing program in NYC can be effective in Des Moines, Iowa. We need to analyze the August 2019 data of NYC bike sharing data to prepare a presentation for an angel investor.

## Results

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

For this NYC Citibike analysis we used seven visualizations:

1. Checkout Times for Users - This sheet shows the length of time users checked out the bike throughout the day. Both genders peaked in the 5-6 hour range and slowly decreases throughout the day.

2 Gender Breakdown - This pie graph just illustrates the number of users by gender and shows the following breakdown: 1,530,272: males; 588,431: females; 225,521: unknown

3 Checkout Times by Gender - This sheet shows the length of time each gender used the bikes throughout the day. All users, regardless of gender are pretty consistent and peak around 5-6 hours of usage a day. Female users peaked at 600-700 users where as the male gender has a sharper and greater peak around 6 hours at 2,152 users checking out.

4 August Peak Hours - This graph shows the start times and shows that most people check out between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm. This makes sense as most people would be going after work during the week and for tourists or people using it on non-working days would be consistent between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm.

5 Trips by Weekday for Each Hour - This heatmap further expands on the number of trips by day of the week and time of day. It confirms that it peaks at 8:00 am between Monday and Friday and 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm as these are the times people would use it for work. The weekend sees a more evenly distributed usage.

6. Trips by Gender for Each Hour for Each Day - This heatmap is just another illustration reinforcing the bike usage by gender, especially that males use the bikes more.

7. User Trips by Gender by Weekday - This heatmap provides a nice breakdown comparing subscribers vs other customers and showing males really use it in the subscriber models. 

## Sumamry

This analysis shows that male subscribers use these bikes a lot and generally for work. I would look at the locations of male subscribers to see the type of businesses in the area for the highest traffic to see if those businesses are in the Des Moines area.
